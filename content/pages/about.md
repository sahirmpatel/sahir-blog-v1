I name myself casually in different social medias and games, but in most cases I'm 'HolaWorld' or 'OlaWod'. My real name is Li Jing-Yi. 'Jing' pronounces like 'jing' in 'jingle bell', and 'Yi' pronounces like letter 'E'. Currently I'm studying Computer Science at Wuhan University.

I don't have any achivements worth mentioning.
